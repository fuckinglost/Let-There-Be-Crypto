This isn't really much of a README yet...
It should evolve with everything else.

Contribution
############

**Above all** note that this is a group endeavor.  If you have a way to improve
this library please voice your opinion.. whether it be on the mailing list, the
wiki, or in a feature request.

Currently every type of cipher is implemented in a seperate python file
in the `cipher` directory.  If you want to contribute to an existing cipher
implementation modify the appropriate file.  If you want to contribute a new
cipher create a file with the appropriate name.

The analysis portion of this library currently has no defined structure.  When
someone places something in the `analyze` folder we can start looking at how
that should be structured.

Note that if you contribute anything that is included in the mainline trunk
for any period of time, please add your name to the CONTRIBUTORS.rst file.
This is how we will keep track of contributions over time.  Seeing as no one
**own** any of the files, please feel free to play with whatever you desire.
